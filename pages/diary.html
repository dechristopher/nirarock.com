					<div class="head2">A Cacophony of Jays</div>
					<div class="text">While walking my dog this morning at Nira Rock I was struck by a cacophony of
						noise coming from a stand of trees on the north end of the upper meadow. Closer investigation
						revealed several blue jays circling and protesting a red tailed hawk, who was jumping ever
						closer to a branch on some sort of coniferous tree (one of the few at Nira).
					</div>
					<div class="text">It seemed too late in the season for fledglings, and yet the hawk was obviously
						intent on something, and the vociferous jays seemed equally intent on driving it away. The hawk
						looked a little clumsy hopping its weight around in close quarters, and the jays looked fierce
						but perhaps not up to the match. This spring, I had watched with pleasure as a pair of jays
						built a nest adjacent to Nira Rock, then brooded (?) their eggs, then fed three young
						hatchlings, only to see the entire hatch destroyed by a marauding crow. So my heart was
						pre-disposed towards these loud and plucky birds, as exciting and breathtaking as a hawk may be.
					</div>
					<div class="text">I picked up a rock, and stood there uncertainly. Might my trying to drive away the
						hawk backfire, might the jays leave instead? What if I actually *hit* something? (The odds of
						this being raised significantly by the very fact that I was trying NOT to). Still, I pitched the
						rock. Two of the eight or so birds flew away. One blue jay, and one slowly and majestically
						flapping red tail hawk.

					<div class="head2">On Moving Out of the Neighborhood</div>
					<div class="text">I took Doah and my daughter Alana for a walk yesterday at about 2pm with a totally
						clear blue sky, starting off tromping through beautiful snow in the upper meadow of Nira. I
						can't quite capture my feelings in writing, but suffice it to say that Nira has been a huge part
						of my experience in JP, and it has surely helped shape Alana. I can only hope that some of her
						earliest and best memories come from our adventures up there &ndash; from discovering flowers
						popping up in &quot;snow bubbles,&quot; as she called them yesterday, to picking off icicles
						from the rock face near Christine's house, to outdoor movies, to reading on the rock with her
						friends before school, to playing hide and seek with Doah and me in the lower meadow, to eating
						handfuls of raspberries and staining her face red for a week, to....
					</div>
					<div class="text">One thing above all struck me yesterday as I looked at the rock face from
						Jefferson Park and the sun blazed in my eyes just above the upper meadow: Nira used to be a
						blight which people in the neighborhood were scared of, and now I was gazing at it with sadness
						and bittersweet memories of early parenthood and my own private meanderings in nature that have
						sustained me in challenging times, right here in the heart of the city.
