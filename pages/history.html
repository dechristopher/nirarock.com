						give or take a few million years &ndash; Jamaica Plain was situated squarely on the earth's
						equator. Conditions were ripe for the formation of a unique kind of stone. It was made up of
						small river rocks, cemented together deep inside the earth by natural mineralization. This
						particular structure gave the stone the appearance of an old-fashioned, fruit-studded Christmas
						pudding. Over millennia of glacial activity, surface erosion, and continental drift, these stone
						formations were eventually exposed here in what is now known as Massachusetts, where they were
						dubbed "puddingstone" by early settlers. The Boston basin, between the Blue Hills and the
						Atlantic Ocean, is one of the few places in the world where this particular puddingstone can be
						found &ndash; along with parts of Western Africa, to which the Massachusetts coast was attached
						before it's long drift northward. This puddingstone is so unique, "Rox"-bury is named for it,
						and it has been dubbed the "official rock of Massachusetts."

						<span class="head2">A few hundred <br/>million years <br/>later, in the <br/>
early 1800s,</span> <br/>the Hyde Square area of Jamaica Plain was largely farmland. Records from that period reference
						farmhouses, barns, a tavern, a slaughterhouse, and – near the dividing line of the extensive
						landholdings of Phineas Withington and Peleg Heath – a prominent ledge of rocks. Known then as
						"Bleiler's Ledge," it's still the dominant landscape feature of the neighborhood: Nira Rock.
					</div>
					<div class="textpad16"><span class="head2">Later in the same century, </span>puddingstone became a
						desirable building material. In the 1870s, Boston accepted <a
								href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Law_Olmsted" target="_blank">Frederick Law
							Olmsted</a>'s bid to design a sinuous system of linked city parks in the "picturesque
						landscape" style.

						</table>
						Now known as the Emerald Necklace, it would require copious amounts of the puddingstone boulders
						that Olmsted favored,
						as well as many more smaller pieces for bridges and walkways. Other notable projects used the
						material as well; <a href="http://www.foresthillscemetery.com/" target="_blank">Forest Hills
							Cemetery</a>, <a href="http://www.oldsouth.org/history.html" target="_blank">New Old South
							Church</a>, and <a href="http://www.iboston.org/mcp.php?pid=brattleSquareCongreg"
						                       target="_blank">The Brattle Square Church</a> are just a few. To satisfy
						the appetite for puddingstone, several quarries opened in the Roxbury area. By the turn of the
						century, most had already closed, as fashions changed and architects turned to other materials.
					</div>
					<div class="textpad16"><span class="head2">In the early 1900s, </span>Jamaica Plain was being
						transformed from a pastoral escape into a suburb of Boston, and the Hyde Square neighborhood was
						no exception. The large farms in the area were divided into small house lots, which were filled
						with Queen Anne single-family houses and the triple-deckers that are still a hallmark of Jamaica
						Plain's architecture. The upper meadow of Nira Rock was itself slated to become twelve tidy
						house lots. Though city maps of the site still clearly show the outlines of these lots, they
						were never built on. Presumably the steep climb of the terrain &ndash; and the inpenetrable
						bedrock of puddingstone &ndash; made the area inhospitable to construction. Whatever the case,
						Nira Rock was spared, and left as public land for future generations to enjoy.

						<span class="head2">The Great Depression of the early 1930s </span>brought with it an imperative
						to get people back to work. As a result, the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) was passed
						in 1933. It authorized the government to create jobs for unemployed workers. One relatively
						small undertaking of this enormous initiative was the reopening of one the puddingstone quarries
						closed years before. The quarry became known by the acronym of the act that re-enlivened it:
						Nira Rock. Though much of the quarry's puddingstone was eventually removed, a dramatic
						outcropping was left behind, which is now at the heart of the Nira Rock site.
					</div>
					<div class="textpad16"><span class="head2">Over the next decades, </span>Nira Rock languished as a
						forgotten, overgrown place. Its seclusion &ndash; with no abutting major roads &ndash; made it
						the perfect place for young people to engage in play (or less innocent pursuits) away from the
						watchful eyes of parents and police. Oral accounts from neighbors indicate that the spot was a
						favorite for high school drinking, as well as Sunday-night bonfires attended &quot;by the whole
						neighborhood.&quot; In the 1970s, neighborhood children affectionately called it "Gilligan's
						Island." But by the late 70s and 80s, the site took a darker turn, as much of the city was
						affected by the burgeoning crack epidemic.
					</div>
					<div class="textpad16"><span class="head2">In the late 1980s, </span><span class="class3">a number of new residential projects were developed in the Nira Rock area. Partly in response to this, <a
									href="http://www.bostonnatural.org" target="_blank">Boston Natural Areas Network</a></span>
						(BNAN) conducted a community forum to discuss the potential utilization of a number of local
						city-held properties. In addition to the creation of a neighborhood park and community garden,
						this process led to the transfer of Nira Rock's ownership from the Boston Department of
						Neighborhood Development to the Boston Parks Department &ndash; and its official recognition as
						a protected Urban Wild.
					</div>
					<div class="textpad16">Through a city-funded grant, BNAN initiated the recovery of Nira Rock,
						including the removal of years of illegally dumped trash and debris, the installation of formal
						entry gates, and the planting of native shrubs, trees and perennials. This important initiative
						laid the groundwork for further improvements.
					</div>
					<div class="textpad16"><span class="head2">In 1990, </span><a href="http://www.earthworksboston.org"
					                                                              target="_blank">Earthworks</a> planted
						a small orchard on the site. In 2000, a handful of neighbors began to discuss how to continue to
						improve the condition of the site and address crime. Shortly thereafter, Friends of Nira Rock
						was formed, and regular site cleanups were initiated. The Parks Department's <a
								href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/parks/urbanwilds" target="_blank">Urban Wilds
							Initiative</a> embraced Nira Rock as a priority and, in 2004, <a
								href="http://www.cogdesign.org" target="_blank">COGdesign</a> created a landscape design
						for the site. In 2005, the founding member of Friends of Nira Rock received a Community Service
						Award from the Boston Police Department, in recognition of her contribution to turning Nira Rock
						around. Momentum grew with the award of grants and donations from several sources &ndash;
						including the city as well as private and non-profit organizations &ndash; for infrastructure
						improvements and ambitious native plantings.
